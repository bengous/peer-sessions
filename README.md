# peer-sessions

A Claude Code skill for running a **fleet of Claude Code sessions on one machine** and making them talk to each other with `SendMessage`.

Claude Code 2.1.224 added cross-session messaging: one session can send a message to another, and that message arrives as a **user prompt** in the receiving session. This skill turns that primitive into a working loop — spawn a fleet, hand out briefs, collect the replies, and tear it down when you ask.

## Install

```bash
npx skills@latest add ray-amjad/peer-sessions
```

Or copy this folder into `~/.claude/skills/peer-sessions/`.

## Requirements

- Claude Code **2.1.224 or newer** on macOS or Linux. Older builds publish no messaging socket, so a session is alive but no other session can reach it.
- [`cmux`](https://github.com/anthropics/cmux) for the spawn scripts. The messaging itself needs no terminal multiplexer — only the fleet layout does.

## The loop

```
spawn a fleet → send a brief to each peer → end your turn → replies arrive as new user turns → hand back the teardown
```

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/peer-sessions/scripts/spawn-fleet.py --placement window \
  orbits:/tmp/lab/orbits planets:/tmp/lab/planets sun:/tmp/lab/sun
```
```
window F8464A83-... (new)
+ orbits    uds:/tmp/cc-socks/17466.sock
+ planets   uds:/tmp/cc-socks/17398.sock
+ sun       uds:/tmp/cc-socks/17585.sock
3 ready in 10s.
```

Then send each peer a brief that ends with your own address, and stop. A peer reply is the notification — it wakes you as a new turn, so a poll loop only burns tokens.

## Where the fleet appears

`--placement` decides the layout. The script prints the matching teardown commands, so you never close more than you made. Teardown is **off by default** — the fleet stays alive, with its context, until you ask for it to go.

| Placement | Where the peers land | Pick it when |
|---|---|---|
| `split` | new panes beside your own pane, in your workspace | 1-3 peers, short work, you want to watch them. Your pane keeps the focus. |
| `workspace` (default) | new workspaces in your window | 3+ peers, or work that runs for minutes. Your current screen stays clean. |
| `window` | a new window, with the workspaces inside it | a big fleet, a screen recording, or a second monitor. |

`--direction right|left|up|down` places each new pane, `--focus true|false` decides whether the UI moves to the fleet, and `--per-workspace 1` gives every session its own workspace. See `references/placement.md`.

## Things that cost time to learn

- **The first send with a bare name always bounces** with "re-send with the ref". That is a confirmation, not a failure. A `uds:` address does not bounce.
- **Start peers in your own permission class.** A receiver *holds* inbound messages for human approval when its class differs from the sender's, so the brief never reaches the model. From an ordinary session that means the default `auto`; from a `--dangerously-skip-permissions` session, pass `--permission-mode bypass`. An `--allowedTools` list stalls on the first tool that is not in the list, either way.
- **A spawned peer must not inherit `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION`.** The script unsets it, along with `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, before each launch. A peer that keeps them registers nothing and cannot be addressed at all.
- **`success: true` means the message arrived**, not that the peer did the work.
- **A send is one-way.** If you want a reply, put your own address in the brief and ask for it.
- **Teardown is opt-in.** Claude leaves the fleet running and gives you the commands. It only tears down when you ask, or when you said so up front at spawn time.
- **When you close the UI, the sessions do not stop.** Kill the process ids first, then close the window.
- **A cmux ref is an index, not an identity.** Close one pane and the rest renumber, so a saved ref can point at the wrong pane. The scripts hold UUIDs (`cmux --id-format both`) for this reason.
- **`cmux close-window` can return `OK` and leave the window open**, and a new window keeps an extra empty shell workspace. `split` and `workspace` placements tear down cleanly from the CLI; `window` may need a Cmd+W.

## Safety

A peer carries none of your user's authority. If your send is denied, or a peer reports a denial, tell the user. Never route around a permission decision through another session.

## Repository layout

The skill lives in [`peer-sessions/`](./peer-sessions), not at the repository
root. When the `skills` CLI clones a source and finds `SKILL.md` at the root of
that clone, it installs the file on its own and never copies the directory, so
`scripts/` and `references/` are left behind. A `SKILL.md` one level down takes
the directory-copy path instead. The branch `fix/linux-cmux-gtk-support` keeps
the original root layout, so it stays diffable against upstream.
